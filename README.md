# Professor Messer's CompTIA A+ (220-1101) Study Notes

This repository contains my personal study notes based on Professor Messer's CompTIA A+ Core 1 (220-1101) video course. These are just my own notes for study purposes - **all the knowledge and content credit goes entirely to Professor Messer**. The notes are structured as a simple, clean, and offline-accessible website, making it easy to study on any device with a web browser.

## ✨ Features

* **Clean & Minimalist Design:** A simple, distraction-free layout that focuses on readability.
* **External CSS:** The entire visual style is controlled by two CSS files, making it easy to update the look of all pages at once.
* **Responsive Layout:** The design works well on both desktop and mobile browsers.
* **Easy Navigation:** A central index page links to all lessons, and each lesson page has "Previous" and "Next" buttons for sequential studying.
* **Ready for Expansion:** The template-based structure makes it simple to add new lessons as you progress through the course.

## 📂 File Structure

The repository is organized to be as simple and maintainable as possible.

```
.
├── README.md               # You are here!
├── index.html             # The main table of contents page for all notes.
├── index-style.css        # The stylesheet for ONLY the index.html page.
├── style.css              # The stylesheet for ALL individual lesson note pages.
├── template.html          # The base template for creating new lesson notes.

└── ...                   # etc.
```

* `index.html`: The homepage. **This is the file you will update every time you add a new lesson.**
* `style.css`: The single CSS file that styles every lesson page (e.g., `1.1.html`, `1.2.html`, etc.).
* `index-style.css`: A separate CSS file just for the homepage to keep its layout distinct.
* `template.html`: A blank template you can copy to create a new lesson page.

## 🚀 How to Add a New Lesson

Follow these steps to add notes for a new video. Let's assume you are adding notes for **Lesson 1.2**.

### Step 1: Create the New Lesson File

1. Make a copy of `template.html`.
2. Rename the copy to match the new lesson number (e.g., `1.2.html`).

### Step 2: Add Your Content

Open the new `1.2.html` file in a text editor and update the following sections:

1. **Update the `<title>`:** Change `<title>Lesson Title - A+ Core 1 (X.X)</title>` to `<title>Mobile Device Displays - A+ Core 1 (1.2)</title>`.
2. **Update the Header:** Change the `<h1>` and `<p>` tags to reflect the new lesson's title and number.
3. **Add the Notes:** Replace the placeholder content inside the `.section` divs with your detailed notes from the video. You can copy and paste the `<div class="section">...</div>` block as many times as you need for different topics within the video.
4. **Update Navigation Buttons:** In the footer, update the `href` links for the "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
   * The "Previous" button should link to `1.1.html`.
   * The "Next" button should link to `1.3.html`.

### Step 3: Update the Index Page

Finally, open `index.html` and add a link to your newly created page. Find the correct topic section (e.g., `1.0 Mobile Devices`) and add a new list item:

```html
<!-- Inside index.html -->
<div class="topic-section">
    <h2>1.0 Mobile Devices</h2>
    <ul class="subtopic-list">
        <li><a href="1.1.html">1.1 Laptop Hardware</a></li>
        <!-- Add this new line -->
        <li><a href="1.2.html">1.2 Mobile Device Displays</a></li> 
    </ul>
</div>
```

That's it! Your new notes are now integrated into the site.

## 🎨 Customization

The visual style can be easily changed by editing the CSS variables at the top of `style.css` and `index-style.css`.

```css
:root {
    --bg-color: #ffffff;
    --text-color: #212529;
    --heading-color: #343a40;
    --accent-color: #007bff;
    --subtle-border-color: #dee2e6;
    --highlight-bg-color: #f1f3f5;
}
```
