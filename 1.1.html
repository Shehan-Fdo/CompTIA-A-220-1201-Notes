        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Hardware Overview</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Laptops are built to <strong>precise specifications</strong>, making repairs challenging due to the compact and proprietary nature of their components.</li>
                <li>The ease of repair varies widely. Some models are designed to be user-serviceable, while others require a complete teardown for simple upgrades.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Laptop Batteries</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Function:</strong> Provides power when the laptop is not connected to an AC outlet.</li>
                <li><strong>Common Types:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Lithium-ion (Li-ion)</strong> and <strong>Lithium-ion polymer (LiPo)</strong> are standard.</li>
                        <li>They do not suffer from the "memory effect," so they can be charged at any time without degrading their long-term capacity.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Form Factor & Replacement:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Modular:</strong> Easily removable and can be replaced in minutes. Common in older or business-class laptops.</li>
                        <li><strong>Integrated:</strong> Built into the laptop case. Replacement is difficult and often requires a full device teardown.</li>
                        <li>Each battery is specific to a laptop model; you cannot interchange them.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Keyboard & Keys</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High Usage:</strong> As a primary input device, the keyboard is one of the most frequently replaced components.</li>
                <li><strong>Replacement:</strong> Many laptops allow keyboard replacement by removing a bezel and a few screws, then disconnecting a single ribbon cable. However, some designs are much more integrated.</li>
                <li><strong>Troubleshooting Tip:</strong> If the built-in keyboard fails, connect an <strong>external USB keyboard</strong> to confirm if the problem is with the hardware or the operating system.</li>
                <li><strong>Individual Keys:</strong> Replacing a single key cap is possible but requires care, as the plastic scissor-switch mechanisms underneath are very delicate and easily broken.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Memory (RAM)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Laptops use a compact memory format called <strong>SO-DIMM</strong> (Small Outline Dual In-line Memory Module).</li>
                <li><strong>Upgradability:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Modular:</strong> Most laptops have accessible memory slots, allowing for easy upgrades or replacements.</li>
                        <li><strong>Soldered:</strong> Some models, particularly ultra-portables, have the RAM soldered directly to the motherboard. This memory <strong>cannot be upgraded</strong>, and if it fails, the entire motherboard must be replaced.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Storage Drives</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Magnetic Disk (HDD):</strong> Uses traditional spinning platters. Laptop HDDs use a <code>2.5-inch</code> form factor.</li>
                <li><strong>Solid-State Drive (SSD):</strong> Uses flash memory with no moving parts. Offers significantly better performance, reliability, and silence.
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>2.5-inch SSD</code>: Same size as a laptop HDD, serving as a direct, easy replacement.</li>
                        <li><code>M.2 SSD</code>: A smaller, card-like drive that plugs directly into an M.2 slot on the motherboard, eliminating the need for data and power cables.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Migrating from HDD to SSD:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provides a massive performance boost, making an old laptop feel new.</li>
                        <li>This can be done by performing a fresh OS install or by using <strong>imaging/cloning software</strong> to create an exact copy of the HDD onto the new SSD. Many SSDs come with this software included.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Wireless & Connectivity</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>802.11 (Wi-Fi) & Bluetooth:</strong> Often combined on a single adapter, either integrated into the motherboard or on a separate card.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Adapter Cards:</strong> Common formats include <code>Mini PCI</code> and <code>Mini PCI Express</code>. These are modular and replaceable.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Antennas:</strong> The physical antenna wires are routed from the adapter card up and around the laptop screen to achieve the best possible signal strength.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Connections are typically labeled <strong>MAIN</strong> and <strong>AUX</strong> for Wi-Fi, with a possible third connection for Bluetooth.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>NFC (Near-field communication):</strong> A very short-range (4cm or less) wireless technology used for payments, data transfer, and authentication (e.g., tapping a badge to log in).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Integrated Peripherals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Biometrics:</strong> Authentication using unique physical traits.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Fingerprint Reader:</strong> A small scanner on the laptop chassis.</li>
                        <li><strong>Face Recognition:</strong> Uses the built-in webcam (e.g., Windows Hello).</li>
                        <li>Both require hardware support on the laptop and configuration within the operating system.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Camera/Webcam & Microphone:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Almost all modern laptops include a built-in webcam and microphone at the top of the display, essential for video conferencing.</li>
                        <li>While convenient, their quality is often basic. For professional use, an external USB microphone or webcam is recommended.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
