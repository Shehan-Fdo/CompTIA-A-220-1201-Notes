                <li>Mobile devices are commonly referred to as <strong>“cell” phones</strong>.</li>
                <li>The term "cell" originates from the structure of <strong>cellular networks</strong>, which divide land into geographical areas or "cells."</li>
                <li>Each cell is covered by an antenna using specific frequencies to provide service.</li>
                <li>Users can enable or disable voice and data services independently.

                <li>A <code>SIM</code> (<strong>Subscriber Identity Module</strong>) is a unique identifier for a cellular device.</li>
                <li>It's often a small, removable physical card.</li>
                <li>Moving the SIM card to another phone effectively transfers your phone number and service to the new device.</li>
                <li>The SIM card contains:
                    <ul>
                        <li>SIM ID and your phone number.</li>

                <li>Bluetooth pairing is the process of connecting two Bluetooth devices securely.</li>
                <li>The general process is:
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Enable Bluetooth</strong> on both devices (e.g., phone and speaker). This is typically in <code>Settings > Bluetooth</code>.</li>
                        <li>Set the peripheral device to <strong>discoverable mode</strong>. This might require holding a button or a specific key sequence.</li>
                        <li>On your phone, <strong>select the discovered device</strong> from the list of available devices.</li>
                        <li><strong>Enter or confirm a <code>PIN</code></strong>. The PIN should be the same on both devices to complete the secure connection.</li>
                        <li><strong>Test connectivity</strong> to ensure the devices are communicating properly.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>

            <h2>GPS (Global Positioning System)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><code>GPS</code> stands for <strong>Global Positioning System</strong>, created by the U.S. Department of Defense.</li>
                <li>It uses a network of over 30 satellites orbiting the Earth to provide precise navigation.</li>
                <li>A device needs to have a clear line of sight to at least <strong>4 satellites</strong> for an accurate location fix.</li>
                <li>Location (<strong>longitude, latitude, altitude</strong>) is determined by calculating the timing differences of signals received from multiple satellites.</li>
                <li>Used for mobile location services like maps, directions, and geotracking.</li>
                <li>Location can also be determined by triangulating signals from <strong>Wi-Fi networks</strong> and <strong>cellular towers</strong>, which is useful when GPS is unavailable.</li>
