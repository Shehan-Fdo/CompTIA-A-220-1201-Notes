        <!-- === Section: The PC Case === -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>The PC Case (Chassis)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The PC case (or tower) houses and protects internal components. Its design impacts expandability, cooling efficiency, and aesthetics.</li>
                <li><strong>Form Factors</strong> dictate which motherboard sizes and components fit inside:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Full Tower:</strong> The largest option. Offers maximum space for multiple storage drives, large graphics cards, and extensive cooling (including custom liquid loops). Ideal for enthusiasts, servers, and high-end workstations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mid Tower:</strong> The most common form factor. Strikes a balance between size and expandability. Typically supports <code>ATX</code> and <code>Micro-ATX</code> motherboards. Suitable for most gaming PCs and office workstations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mini Tower:</strong> Designed for smaller spaces. Supports <code>Micro-ATX</code> and <code>Mini-ITX</code> motherboards. Limited room for expansion cards and drives. Good for basic office PCs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Small Form Factor (SFF):</strong> Extremely compact, usually for <code>Mini-ITX</code> boards. Requires specialized parts like low-profile coolers and <code>SFX</code> power supplies. Ideal for HTPCs (Home Theater PCs) or space-constrained areas.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- === Section: Power Supply Unit === -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Power Supply Unit (PSU)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The PSU converts <strong>Alternating Current (AC)</strong> from the wall into <strong>Direct Current (DC)</strong> used by internal components.</li>
                <li><strong>Wattage:</strong> The maximum output power. Requirements depend on the components (e.g., a high-end GPU like an RTX 4080 needs a higher wattage PSU than a basic office PC).</li>
                <li><strong>Efficiency Rating (80 PLUS):</strong> Indicates how efficiently the PSU converts power. Higher efficiency means less heat and lower energy bills.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ratings range from <strong>80 PLUS Bronze</strong> (82-85% efficient) to <strong>80 PLUS Titanium</strong> (90-94% efficient).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cabling Types:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Non-Modular:</strong> All cables are permanently attached. Cheaper, but results in cable clutter.</li>
                        <li><strong>Semi-Modular:</strong> Essential cables (Motherboard/CPU) are attached; peripheral cables are detachable.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fully Modular:</strong> All cables are detachable. Allows for the best cable management and custom aesthetics.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- === Section: Optical Drives === -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Optical Drives (Optional)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Used to read/write data to discs. They connect via a <code>SATA</code> interface.</li>
                <li><strong>CD-ROM/CD-RW:</strong> Reads/Writes Compact Discs (lowest capacity).</li>
                <li><strong>DVD-ROM/DVD-RW:</strong> Reads/Writes Digital Versatile Discs. Higher capacity than CDs.</li>
                <li><strong>Blu-ray Drives:</strong> Highest capacity optical media. Used for HD movies and large data backups.</li>
                <li><em>Note:</em> Optical drives are less common in modern builds but are still useful for archival purposes or legacy media.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- === Section: Exercises === -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Exercises & Scenarios</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scenario 1 (HTPC Build):</strong> A user wants a compact living room PC.
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Recommendation:</em> <strong>SFF (Small Form Factor)</strong> case.</li>
                        <li><em>Considerations:</em> Must select a <code>Mini-ITX</code> motherboard and likely an <code>SFX</code> power supply or low-profile CPU cooler.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Scenario 2 (Gaming PSU Selection):</strong> Choosing between a 650W Bronze vs. 750W Gold for a high-end build.
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Recommendation:</em> <strong>80 PLUS Gold 750W</strong>.</li>
                        <li><em>Reasoning:</em> Provides more wattage headroom for powerful components/overclocking and operates with greater energy efficiency (generating less heat).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Scenario 3 (Compatibility):</strong> Can an old DVD-RW drive read a new Blu-ray game disc?
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Answer:</em> <strong>No</strong>. DVD drives cannot read the higher data density of Blu-ray discs. (However, Blu-ray drives are backward compatible and can read DVDs).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- === Section: Real-World Application === -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Real-World Application</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Help Desk Technician:</strong> Diagnosing "No Power" issues often involves identifying if the PSU fan is spinning or if motherboard LEDs are active.</li>
                <li><strong>System Integrator:</strong> Must select components that match client needs (e.g., choosing a sound-dampened case and high-efficiency PSU for a "silent workstation").</li>
                <li><strong>Network Administrator:</strong> Knowledge of form factors and power redundancy scales up to server hardware management.</li>
            </ul>
