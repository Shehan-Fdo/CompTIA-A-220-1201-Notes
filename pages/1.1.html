        <!-- === Section: Overview === -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Personal computers (PCs) are ubiquitous tools, but their internal workings can seem complex. Understanding the fundamental components within a PC is the first step towards diagnosing issues, performing upgrades, and building systems.</li>
                <li>Each component plays a specific role, working in concert to process data, store information, and enable interaction with the user.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- === Section: The PC Case === -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>The PC Case: Housing the Components</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The PC case, sometimes referred to as the chassis or tower, is the external enclosure that protects and houses all the internal components of a computer. Cases come in various sizes and designs, impacting expandability, cooling efficiency, and aesthetic appeal.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- === Section: Form Factors === -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Form Factors</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Case form factors dictate which motherboard sizes and, consequently, which components can be installed.</li>
                <li><strong>Full Tower:</strong> These are the largest cases, offering maximum space for multiple storage drives, large graphics cards, extensive cooling solutions (including custom liquid cooling), and multiple optical drives. Full towers are often chosen by enthusiasts, gamers, or users requiring extensive server-like capabilities within a PC. For example, a video editor building a workstation might opt for a full tower to accommodate multiple high-capacity hard drives, several powerful GPUs, and a robust cooling system to handle sustained rendering tasks. A hypothetical scenario involves a developer building a personal server for virtual machines, requiring space for eight hard drives and an oversized air cooler for the CPU.</li>
                <li><strong>Mid Tower:</strong> The most common form factor, mid towers strike a balance between size and expandability. They typically support ATX and Micro-ATX motherboards and offer sufficient space for most common builds, including gaming PCs and workstations. An average user building a gaming PC might choose a mid tower, as it provides enough room for a standard ATX motherboard, a powerful graphics card, and a couple of SSDs without occupying excessive desk space.</li>
                <li><strong>Mini Tower:</strong> Designed for smaller spaces, mini towers primarily support Micro-ATX and Mini-ITX motherboards. They have less room for expansion cards and storage drives compared to mid or full towers, making them suitable for basic office PCs or home theater PCs (HTPCs). A small business owner might use mini tower PCs for administrative tasks, where space is at a premium and high-end components are not required.</li>
                <li><strong>Small Form Factor (SFF):</strong> These cases are extremely compact and are specifically designed for Mini-ITX motherboards. They prioritize minimal footprint and often require specialized, smaller components like low-profile CPU coolers and SFX power supplies. SFF PCs are ideal for HTPCs, compact workstations, or systems where space is the absolute priority, even at the cost of expansion or cooling capacity. For example, a user building a discreet media server that sits next to their TV would likely choose an SFF case.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- === Section: Power Supply Unit === -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Power Supply Unit (PSU): Delivering Electrical Energy</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The Power Supply Unit (PSU) converts the alternating current (AC) from the wall outlet into direct current (DC) that the computer components require to operate. The PSU is crucial because it supplies power to the motherboard, CPU, graphics card, storage drives, and other peripherals.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- === Section: PSU Specifications === -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>PSU Specifications</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wattage:</strong> PSUs are rated by their maximum output wattage. The required wattage depends on the power consumption of all components in the PC. High-end graphics cards and powerful multi-core CPUs demand higher wattage PSUs. For instance, a basic office PC with an integrated graphics processor might only need a 300W PSU, whereas a high-end gaming PC with a dedicated graphics card like an NVIDIA RTX 4080 might require an 850W or even 1000W PSU. A hypothetical user upgrading their existing system with a new, power-hungry GPU would need to ensure their current PSU can deliver sufficient wattage, or risk system instability or damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficiency Rating (80 PLUS):</strong> This rating indicates how efficiently the PSU converts AC to DC, with higher efficiency meaning less wasted energy as heat and lower electricity bills. Ratings range from 80 PLUS Bronze (82-85% efficient) to 80 PLUS Titanium (90-94% efficient at various loads). For example, an 80 PLUS Gold PSU operates at around 87-90% efficiency under typical loads, while an 80 PLUS Bronze might be 82-85%. Enterprises often prioritize higher efficiency PSUs for their data centers to reduce energy consumption and cooling costs over many systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Modular vs. Non-Modular:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Non-Modular PSUs:</strong> All cables are permanently attached, leading to more cable clutter inside the case but often being less expensive. This is common in budget-oriented systems where aesthetics and cable management are secondary concerns.</li>
                        <li><strong>Semi-Modular PSUs:</strong> Essential cables (like the motherboard and CPU power cables) are permanently attached, while others (for drives, graphics cards) are detachable. This offers a good balance of cost and cable management.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fully Modular PSUs:</strong> All cables are detachable, allowing for maximum flexibility in cable management and often preferred by enthusiasts or those building custom systems. For instance, a PC builder aiming for a clean aesthetic with custom braided cables would always opt for a fully modular PSU.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- === Section: Optical Drive === -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Optical Drive (Optional): Reading Discs</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>While less common in modern builds, optical drives read and write data to optical discs such as CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs. They connect to the motherboard via a SATA interface and typically receive power from the PSU via a SATA power connector.</li>
                <li><strong>CD-ROM/CD-RW Drives:</strong> Used for compact discs. CD-ROM (Read-Only Memory) drives can only read data, while CD-RW (Rewritable) drives can also write data to rewritable CDs. An older system might still use a CD-RW drive for burning music CDs or backing up small files.</li>
                <li><strong>DVD-ROM/DVD-RW Drives:</strong> Handle Digital Versatile Discs, offering higher capacity than CDs. DVD-RW drives can read and write DVDs. Many older software installations or movie collections might still rely on DVD drives.</li>
                <li><strong>Blu-ray Drives:</strong> The highest capacity optical drives, primarily used for high-definition movies and large data backups. For example, a home theater PC builder might include a Blu-ray drive to play physical Blu-ray movies on their system. A hypothetical scenario might involve a professional photographer needing to back up several terabytes of raw image files onto multiple Blu-ray discs for archival purposes, making an internal Blu-ray writer a necessary component.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- === Section: Exercises === -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Exercises</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A user wants to build a compact PC for their living room to stream movies and browse the web. They have limited space and prioritize a small footprint. Which PC case form factor would be most appropriate, and why? Name two considerations for component selection in such a build.</li>
                <li>A system builder is putting together a high-end gaming PC featuring a powerful discrete graphics card and an overclockable CPU. They are trying to decide between an 80 PLUS Bronze 650W PSU and an 80 PLUS Gold 750W PSU. Assuming both fit their budget, which PSU would be the better choice for this specific build, and what are the primary reasons for this recommendation?</li>
                <li>Your friend has an old computer with a DVD-RW drive. They recently purchased a new video game that comes on a Blu-ray disc. Will their existing optical drive be able to read and install the game? Explain why or why not, referencing the different types of optical media.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- === Section: Real-World Application === -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Real-World Application</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Understanding PC components is critical for various roles in the IT industry. For instance, a Help Desk Technician frequently needs to identify components over the phone or in person to diagnose issues. If a customer reports their computer isn't turning on, the technician might ask about the PSU's fan spinning or LEDs on the motherboard, requiring knowledge of where these components are located and their basic function.</li>
                <li>Another application is for a System Builder or Integrator. When designing a custom PC for a client, they must select compatible components that meet performance and budget requirements. For example, if a client requests a "silent workstation," the builder must choose a case with sound dampening features and a highly efficient PSU that runs quietly, demonstrating practical application of form factors and PSU efficiency ratings.</li>
                <li>A Network Administrator might be tasked with upgrading server hardware; while servers have different components than consumer PCs, the foundational knowledge of components like PSUs (often redundant in servers) and chassis types is directly transferable.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
